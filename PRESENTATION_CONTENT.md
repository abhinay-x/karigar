- 🌍 **Language barriers** - English-only platforms exclude them
- 💔 **Cultural heritage dying** - traditional crafts losing relevance

**The Gap:**
- Global handmade market: **$718 billion**
- Indian artisan share: **<2%** despite having 23% of world's artisans
- **Lost potential:** ₹2.8 trillion annually

### Image Prompt:
```
"Split screen image: Left side shows a traditional Indian artisan in a rural setting working on beautiful crafts but looking worried about money, surrounded by amazing pottery and textiles.
